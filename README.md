## Features
- goes up to 38 rows (after that it continuously exceeds javascript's max safe int)
- is color coded for initial columns, then alternate colors
- has horizontal lines for easy reading
- Renders only once to minimize lag (if i rendered continuouly it would lag, and there's no need for that)
